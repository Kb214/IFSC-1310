  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    I think that Progressive Enhancement is a very great way to build a website. I like how we have steps to
    take on what to focus on rather than how graceful degradation focuses on the web browser capabilities.To
    me Progressive Enhancement basically just gives us a basic groundwork on website building with content 
    being the end all be all. Without the content why is the user there in the first place if we don’t have
    anything and it’s not cohesive? I think that Graceful Degradation could be useful when the website is 
    already finished, you’ve already worked on the important stuff that makes a website and now all you have
    to do with Graceful Degradation is to make it better on popular search engines.

  <h2>Project Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Issue that I had was mostly with the phone version of the website. I mostly had problems with the navigation
    and the bottom page links. I think I could’ve added a hamburger menu for the navigation and made the text bigger
    on the bottom at a certain pixel amount. I think I did the file organization well, css, and the content well. 
    I have to work on javascript some more though. If I had to start over I would try to carve out some time to work on
    it and also look into javascript more as I’m not too comfortable with it just yet.
