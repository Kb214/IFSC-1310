                  discontinued in 2012. This 4.8L V10 powered supercar wowed everyone at
                  that time with its sound, engineering, and exclusivity. It has 500 hp 
                  and can go from zero to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds. At the time it was praised 
                  for its advanced carbon fiber construction and its F1 sounding exhaust. Today it’s a
                  collectors item since only 500 hundred units were produced. It would cost

                  The Lexus LS 400 line started in 1990 and has been discontinued since 1994. 
                  This iconic car is what launched the Lexus brand itself. It has a 4.0L V8, a 
                  whisper-quiet cabin, and is very smooth to ride in. This car is known to be 
                  underpriced but also overbuilt and highly reliable. Many 400s have surpassed 
                  300,000 plus milesThis car is considered a masterclass in quality and engineering 
                  and set the tone for what Lexus would become in the future.

                  Of course I didn’t forget my SUV! The RX 350. This SUV is actually the most
                  popular Lexus automobile in the present day. It started in 2006 and is still 
                  ongoing and people often try to imitate it. This SUV went on from 2006 to become 
                  a segment creator. Inventing the luxury crossover since it mixed sedan comfort 
                  with SUV appeal. Not only that, this is a family staple car that is great for road 
                  trips. It hits the sweet spot of not-a-truck but has space. The RX 350 specs include
                  a V6 engine, AWD (All Wheel Drive), and an amazing interior. It starts at a price 
                  of $50,475 for a FWD (Forward Wheel Drive) and $52,075 for an AWD.
