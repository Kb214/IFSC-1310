                <h2>SHORT HISTORY</h2>
                <p>
                In 1986, Toyota's longtime advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi formed a specialized unit, Team One, to handle marketing for the
                new brand. Image consulting firm Lippincott & Margulies was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names; Vectre, Verone,
                Chaparel, Calibre and Alexis were chosen as top candidates. While Alexis quickly became the front runner, concerns were raised
                that the name applied to people more than cars. As a result, the first letter was removed and the "i" replaced with a "u" to morph 
                the name to Lexus.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu) is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. 
                  The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and territories worldwide and is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars. 
                  It has ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global brands in market value.Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan.
                  Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Plano, Texas, United States.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 
                  2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover 
                  debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its own F marque performance division in 
                  2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.

                  The F1 project was completed in 1989, involving 60 designers, 24 engineering teams, 1,400 engineers, 2,300 technicians, 220 support 
                  workers, approximately 450 prototypes and more than $1 billion in costs. The resulting car, the Lexus LS 400, had a design that shared 
                  no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles, with a new 4.0 L V8 gasoline engine and rear-wheel drive.The car debuted in January 
                  1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit and official sales of the vehicle began the following September at a 
                  network of 81 new Lexus dealerships in the U.S.
