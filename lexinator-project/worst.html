                <h2>The Worst Lexus Cars</h2>
                <p>
                  Ever since the release of the LS400, Lexus has been on a track record of greatness with their catchphrase
                  being “The relentless pursuit of pursuit of perfection”. Though, they are only human and can make some 
                  few missteps with their car manufacturing. These vehicles are criticized for performance, design flaws,
                  and/or  poor value compared to other Lexus vehicles. 
                </p>

                <h3>Why are these cars the WORST?</h3>
                <p>
                  Let's find out for ourselves!

              <ul id="best-worst-cars">
                <li>ES 350</li>
                <img src="assets/img/lexus-es-350-300px.jpg" class="img-center" alt="2007 Lexus ES 350"/>
                <p>
                  Back then in 2007 this looked like a very fancy toyota. Today..not so much. But despite
                  the perception of its looks, there were actual serious complaints about the bad 
                  manufacturing of ES 350. Unintended acceleration was the biggest thing because the floor
                  mats had a potential to trap the gas pedal. This caused a huge recall and damaged 
                  the Lexus’ reputation of safety at the time. The other complaints were transmission
                  hesitation, quick wearing leather seats, and plastics. The driving overall was very
                  soft. This is because of the suspension. The steering felt disconnected and gave 
                  drivers less confidence behind the wheel. This car was discontinued in 2008.

                <li>HS 250h</li>
                <img src="assets/img/lexus-hs-250h-300px.jpg" class="img-center" alt="2010 Lexus HS 350 Hybrid"/>
                <p>
                  The 2010 Lexus HS 250h is the first dedicated hybrid sedan. Unfortunately, people did
                  not like this. It’s an underpowered hybrid. The setup of 187 hp couldn’t keep up
                  with the weight of the car, the fuel economy was disappointing for a hybrid, and 
                  the car had awkward proportions. This stands out because it was marketed as eco-luxury
                  but it fell short on performance and luxury. On the luxury side of things, the 
                  batteries intruded into the trunk so there wasn’t a lot of cargo space. The interior
                  design felt less premium and had outdated infotainment at launch. This sedan was
                  discontinued in 2012 because of poor sales.

                <li>SC 430</li>
                <img src="assets/img/lexus-sc-430-300px.jpg" class="img-center" alt="2001 Lexus SC 430"/>
                <p>
                  The proportions of this vehicle were equally as awkward as the HS 250h. The 
                  interior was indeed luxurious, but the tech age was poor. The issues in the
                  manufacturing side was that the performance didn’t match looks or price. It had a 
                  very powerful 4.3L V8 but the car was super heavy weighing over 4,000lbs so it felt 
                  very sluggish. The soft suspension and vague steering made it feel like a boat instead
                  of a supercar. There was no feedback through the steering wheel or chassis making
                  the driver bored because of no engagement. This car had a huge cultural backlash
                  behind it as well. It was torn to shreds by critics like Jeremy Clarkson. He said
                  on “Top Gear” that it was “the worst car in the world”. It became known as a luxury
                  car that focused on looks  more than performance. This car started manufacturing in 
                  2001 and discontinued by 2005.
